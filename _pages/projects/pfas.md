###  PFAS Stacked Bar Plot – Sandia Wetland

This R script creates a stacked bar chart showing the concentrations of PFAS chemicals detected at different sampling sites in Upper Sandia Canyon. It combines data from alluvial wells and surface water gaging stations, focusing on results collected from 2024 stormflow, baseflow, and groundwater sampling events. All data are publicly available at intellusnm.com

<small>Figure: Stacked bar plot of PFAS concentrations in Upper Sandia Canyon. This visualization compares detected PFAS compounds across monitoring locations, grouped by hydrologic condition: stormflow (6/20/2024), baseflow (7/30/2024), and shallow alluvial groundwater (10/24/2024). Sampling dates were chosen close in time to help assess potential PFAS sources within the Sandia wetland system. The stacked format highlights both the relative contribution of individual PFAS chemicals and the overall concentration profile at each site...</small>
