Hey there, I’m **Russ**, an environmental scientist with a long-standing love for maps, data, and the way landscapes tell stories. I’ve worked across the Southwest for years, combining GIS, hydrology, and environmental monitoring to make sense of complex systems.  

I’m based in northern New Mexico and work with the watershed monitoring team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. My focus includes stormwater and sediment data analysis, PCB and PFAS studies, and detecting geomorphic and vegetation change using LiDAR and hyperspectral imagery.  

I’ve been using GIS for over two decades, from international conservation projects to local stormwater studies, and I’m always looking for new ways to visualize complex environmental data. This site collects some of that work, part science, part storytelling.
