 **Notes:**
- All scripts are hosted in the [Environmental-R-Scripts repo](https://github.com/r-lyon/Environmental-R-Scripts).  
- Screenshots above show example outputs â€” click the links to see full scripts and data.  
- Scripts are maintained under their own branch (`master`) and do not need to live in the portfolio repo.
